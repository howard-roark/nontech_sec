<p>We have been forced into a world where we have no choice but to use computers and the internet for
almost every aspect of our lives.  Unfortunately the people who are <em>smart</em> enough to make this all
<em>work</em> have not taken the time to explain it to those who do not have thousands of hours to figure
it out.  This is a small attempt at bridging that gap, just a little.</p>
