You never really know who it's from or where it leads to at first glance.  Links can point to
addresses that are not what they are displayed as.  For example you may think you are clicking on a
link to a product on Amazon but really to a hacker's machine located at amaazon.com where he will
steal your password once you enter it on his site.
